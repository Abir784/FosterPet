# **FosterPet**  
FosterPet is a platform designed to connect loving foster homes with pets in need. Whether you're a shelter looking to place animals temporarily, or an individual wanting to open your home to a furry friend, FosterPet makes the process seamless, safe, and rewarding.  

## **Project Objectives**
FosterPet makes pet adoption and fostering easy by connecting adopters, shelters, and foster homes on a simple platform. It allows direct communication and has an easy registration process so more people can join. The project helps reduce pet abandonment by providing better foster care options and supports pet owners who need temporary care for their pets. It also raises awareness about pet fostering and adoption, encouraging more people to give pets a safe and loving home.
